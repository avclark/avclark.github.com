I've been thinking a lot about what it means that we, as human beings, were created to be worshippers. It's built into us. It's part of our DNA. We don't have a choice but to worship something. And when the proverbial rubber meets the road, we are left with only two options; we worship ourselves or we worship God.

That may not seem obvious or true, but as I look back over my life and the choices and situations that have brought me to the present, I very clearly see that every day I was either building the kingdom self or the kingdom of God.  

In addition to being worshippers, we are also sinners. And for some reason, we seem to believe that when we put two sinners together, we won't get more sin. But we do. And often, this realization can be an awakening experience.

### An Example

When I met my wife, it was truly love at first site. We've spent nearly every day together since our first date. And in the beginning it was amazing. We were so happy and it felt like it couldn't go wrong. We would not end up divorced, like many of the couples around us. And while we haven't divorced, we've come close. And looking back I see how supremely devoted my wife and I have been to our own respective kingdoms.

I had plans for who I wanted to be and who I wanted my wife to be and what kind of family we would have and what our kids would be like and what kind of church we would serve, etc., etc. She had her versions of those dreams as well. 

And in the beginning this was not a problem because we were so in love with each other. Pleasing each other was our only concern. We fit into each other's kingdoms very well, it seemed. 

But it didn't take long for things to breakdown. My wife started becoming an obstacle to my kingdom and I to hers.

### What Then

It's hard to see flaws in the people you love, especially when the relationship is new. The flaws are there, but we minimize and gloss over them. We are <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/twitterpated">twitterpated</a>, as it were, and it's normal. But as we settle in and become more comfortable with each other, we find that those little details, habits and idiosyncrasies that we once loved have become annoyances and we start to see our kingdom crumble just a bit. The dreams we had for our lives get a little chipped and dusty and enough time passes and we look at our spouse and think, "How did we get here? This is not what I thought it would be."

Sadly, many of us are not willing to surrender our kingdoms. Most of us, myself included, haven't even recognized that a battle of worship has been taking place. We see our spouse as the main obstacle to our happiness (kingdom), so we move on. We cut our losses and try again. 

But God's grace can explode that. Consider this:

>His grace purposes to expose and to free you from your bondage to you. His grace is meant to bring you to the end of yourself so that you will finally begin to place your identity, your meaning and purpose and your inner sense of well-being in him. So he places you in a comprehensive relationship with another flawed person, and he places that relationship right in the middle of a very broken world. To add to this, he designs circumstances for you that you would never have designed for yourself. All of this is meant to bring you to the end of yourself, because that is where true righteousness begins. He wants you to give up. He wants you to abandon your dream. He wants you to face the futility of trying to manipulate the other person into your service. He knows there is no life to be found in these things.

Amazing things started happening for me when I realized this. When I am in service to God's kingdom, my relationships take on a completely new significance and meaning. *I stop viewing people in relation to me, but in relation to God.* My wife is no longer the person who's habits sometimes annoy me, but an adopted child that God loves and has amazing plans for. I stop being pissed because she isn't doing what I want and am instead filled with excitement that *I* was chosen to help her realize her full potential in Christ. That is an amazing feeling and can completely turn the tide of a relationship.

Lately I've been praying that God's will would be done, right here, right now, in my marriage as it is in heaven. I think good things will come from that prayer.
