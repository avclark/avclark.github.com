Before I was a web designer, before I was a journalist, before I was a landscaper and a dog-walker, before, even, I was out of elementary school, I used to write stories.

My first stories were Choose Your Own Adventures (remember those?) set in the Star Wars universe. I would fill these little red-spined black notebooks with stories about Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.

The choose your own adventure part was complicated for my 10-year-old mind. For those of you not familiar with these wonderful books, the reader assumed the role of the protagonist and made choices that determined the main character's actions and the plot's outcome. After a few pages, the reader would face a series of options, each of which would lead to more options resulting in dozens of various endings.  

As a kid I loved the interactivity of it and I would read through each potential story arc dozens of times. 

When I decided to write my own, I would complete each story separately and then attempt to combine them. I would write a few pages, skip some blank pages, write a few more pages, skip more, and so on. When I went back to fill in the other story arcs, I would inevitably run out of blank space and have to fill the notebooks with loose leaf pages, creating a page-numbering and organizational nightmare. Before long it would be a complete mess. If only Pages or Word had existed in 1989.

I was really proud of those books, but I could never bring myself to let anyone read them except for my mom. I really wanted to be a writer, but even at 10-years-old, I had an innate fear of failure. 

I was so afraid of my work not being perfect (and therefore not respected in my mind) that I eventually stopped writing. I journaled sporadically, but writing as an exercise in thought and creativity stopped. 

I made a few more attempts, such as the monthly Clark Family Newsletter when I was 14, blogging in college and even working as a journalist for a few years, but it never stuck. The give-me-perfection-or-give-me-death syndrome never disappeared and to this day plagues most of what I do.

It has been six years since my last attempt at blogging and even journaling has been a rarity. Getting married, having kids, starting a business and all the ephemera of life has consumed my time. But I have felt the void that writing used to fill. 

Part of my fear is that I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said (and said better) by others. I want to be great at something, to own something and pursue it with passion and be the best at it. But it's a vicious cycle, because, for me, writing isn't so much a way to express what I think, as it is a way to discover what I think. So, I have an urge to write and think deeply. But whenever that familiar creative spark comes knocking, it's always accompanied by that also-familiar fear of failure.

I realize all of this sounds incredibly myopic. All two of you who are reading this (hi mom), are probably thinking, "Dude, get over yourself and just write." That's what I would think. But fear of rejection is incredibly powerful. 

I've spotted this recently in my soon-to-be 5-year-old daughter. Izzie is incredibly talented, but I see her shyness and reticence at times to show me her creations and I feel a knot in my stomach because I know what she's feeling. And I want to tell her, "You're drawing is awesome. Keep creating. Don't give up."

I turned 32 this year, my kids are about to start school and I often find myself reminiscing and wondering where the time has gone. I've realized that I live a very reactionary life. Somewhere along the way I learned that what mattered most was what other people thought of me. And the acceptance and adulation of my peers (and the fear of being a failure in their eyes) began to drive everything I did. 

These thoughts shape and touch so much more of my life than writing, but writing is one of the first dreams I remember giving up because I knew I could never be good enough at it.

That said, one thing age has brought with it is little less concern with what people think. Don't misunderstand, I'm still plenty concerned, but not quite as much as I used to be. I don't want to live my life for the applause of others anymore (which can be a hard habit to break when you've been doing it your whole life). 

Believe me, I will find any excuse to keep from putting myself out there. But I know that, in the end, a fear-based, reactionary life will hurt only me. 

So I'm resuming this blog in hopes that forcing myself out into the water will help bring about some positive changes. There are no plans or goals. I will write about anything that interests me, front-end web development, business, raising kids, marriage, faith. This is likely the only blog on the internet where you will be able to read back to back articles about CSS and Jesus. And I've thought a lot about whether that mix is appropriate, but it's all part of me. I've been learning that I shouldn't wait to act until I have the perfect solution. This blog is an exercise in *doing*, in creating movement in myself. I do hope, however, it proves useful and encouraging to others who may have found themselves with similar thoughts and in similar places. As always, I welcome your thoughts and insights. 

Happy reading. 

_*On a side note, publishing this article was incredibly difficult (see above). I've been in the process of designing this blog for years. But I decided yesterday (Sept. 4, 2012) to just start writing. So far this is the only page. There is no header, footer, index or comments. The rest of the site doesn't even exist yet. I'm publishing it anyway, though, because if I don't do it now, it will never happen._
