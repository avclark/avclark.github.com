Do you ever feel like parenting is harder than it used to be? There are so many methods and "best practices" to raising children these days, all of them supported vehemently by their proponents. If our kids eat sugar, watch TV, aren't reading by 3 and in piano lessons by 4, we're certain they're headed for a life of drug addiction and serial killing. 

My wife and I joke that we were the last generation of tough kids. Our parents let us do things no modern parent would dream of allowing. We disappeared into the woods for entire days with no cell phone, no way of reporting an injury or letting our moms know where we were. These days, I don't even see kids out playing in their yards. 

We had BB gun wars. Seriously. We shot each other with BB guns. Can you imagine that happening today? Now, everything has to be padded, helmeted, checked for psychological side effects and child-proofed. 

Since parenting is a learn-as-you-go sort of thing, books, speakers, seminars and advice abound. And that's great. There's nothing wrong with trying to make the maze that is parenting easier to navigate. But it's easy to become overwhelmed. I see so many parents act like every choice they make will have life-altering consequences for their kids.

This is especially true in regard to spirituality. I'm a Christian and I want my kids to love Jesus. But I have a tendency to take myself too seriously and attach too much importance to my actions, as if those actions could really hinder the plans God has for my kids.

Still, it's easy to fall into the trap of fearing that I'm doing it wrong, that my example isn't good enough or my discipline isn't consistent enough or my love isn't unconditional enough and that my kids are going to be set on an unalterable trajectory to heaven or hell because of it. The good news is that my faithfulness is not what will save my children.

Having said that, I often miss the point. Many times, Jesus or no Jesus, what I really want for my kids is to obey, be polite, grow up to get a good job, marry a nice person and avoid the really bad stuff. But what this produces is moralism.

>Let's face it: most of our children believe that God is happy if they're "good for goodness' sake." We've transformed the holy, terrifying, magnificent, and loving God of the Bible into Santa and his elves. And instead of transmitting the gloriously liberating and life-changing truths of the gospel, we have taught our children that what God wants from them is morality.

It's tempting to make the Bible a handbook for life, a collection of divine fables that all end with a moral. We tell our kids to dare to be a Daniel. We hold up Abraham, Joseph or David as examples to follow and Judas or Jonah as examples to avoid. But this sends the message that what God is primarily concerned with is their behavior.

>When we change the story of the Bible from the gospel of grace to a book of moralistic teachings [law]…all sorts of things go wrong. Unbelieving children are encouraged to display the fruit of the Holy Spirit even though they are spiritually dead in their trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:1). Unrepentant children are taught to say that they're sorry and ask for forgiveness even though they've never tasted true godly sorrow. Unregenerate kids are told that they are pleasing to God because they have achieved some "moral victory." Good manners have been elevated to the level of Christian righteousness. Parents discipline their kids until they evidence a prescribed form or contrition, and others work hard at keeping their children from the wickedness in the world, assuming that the wickedness within their children has been handled because they prayed a prayer one time at Bible club…Every way we try to make our kids good that isn't rooted in the good news of the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ is damnable, crushing, despair-breeding, Pharisee-producing law. We won't get the results we want from the law. We'll get either shallow self-righteousness or blazing rebellion or both (frequently from the same kid on the same day!). We'll get moralistic kids who are cold and hypocritical and who look down on others…or you'll get teens who are rebellious and self-indulgent and who can't wait to get out of the house.

But the gospel is different. The gospel explodes all of that. The gospel tells our kids that they're right to give up, they're right to quit trying to accomplish a law that only one person could accomplish. The gospel reorients their world off of themselves and onto the one who fulfilled that law in their place.

My kids need to hear the truth that they are far worse than they think they are and far more loved than they could ever imagine. That is the main thing. That is what they need to see and hear from me every day. Could it be that everything else is peripheral?

In reality, there are few non-negotiables in parenting. Sure, it's great when they get along with their siblings and don't whine, but there's no straight line from watching TV as a kid to sociopathy as an adult. And we put undue pressure on ourselves when we give our own performance life-and-death significance. The same gospel that applies to our children applies to us as well. 

When my kids are grown, what I want them to remember is that I made the main thing the main thing. They may completely disagree with me about everything and think I did it all wrong, but I want them to be able to look back and know that I loved them and I loved Jesus. And the gospel of grace is the only thing that can make that a reality.
