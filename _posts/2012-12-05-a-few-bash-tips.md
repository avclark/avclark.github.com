As I become more and more comfortable with the OS X terminal, I find that I actually prefer it to using a GUI. But, if you're in the terminal a lot, you'll want to make some customizations. My friend, [Adam Simpson](http://www.adamsimpson.net) has put together some great stuff for customizing terminal colors and prompts as well as some great functions. Be sure and check out the "ht" function he created. It's already a permanent part of my workflow.
