title: Life As An Experiment
sub: Action vs. observation, doing vs. dreaming

I've written before about fear of failure, but I don't think the point can be emphasized enough that it's ok to fail, it's ok to try something different, it's ok to experiment. 

One of the things I think makes me a good web developer is that I have always been truly fascinated with efficiency and process. I look at almost everything in my life through the lens of "how could this be more streamlined." I'm almost OCD about it. That can be good, but it can also be really bad. It can lead to stagnation, to an always-play-it-safe lifestyle. 

I (attempt to) stage my life like a play, everything intentionally designed and placed for maximum effect. The problem is that once everything is in place, I don't want to touch it. I don't want to mess it up. But this turns life into a sort of museum, best observed from a distance and definitely not touched. 

When I was a kid, my dad had this IBM 286 computer. Many times I would take it apart, clean all the components, put it back together, install Windows 3.1, ensuring that everything was running as fast and as smoothly as possible. But then nothing. Once it was up and running, the fun was over for me. I didn't want to actually *use* it for anything. My enjoyment was in the assembly and disassembly, figuring out how it worked and trying to make it work better. 

Again, I'm not saying this is a bad thing, that we shouldn't strive for efficiency. But when applied to many areas of life, it doesn't work. Or at least it's no fun. Life was meant to be lived and experienced, not run like clockwork. 

Part of what drives this for me is a fear of failure. What if I break it? What if I make the wrong choice and I am not as happy as I could have been? Or worse, what if I make the wrong choice and my family is effected negatively?

I think often we have to just make a decision and go with it, good or bad. 

I've always admired my sister and brother-in-law in this regard. They don't live life by anybody else's rules. They don't make decisions because of accepted wisdom or process. They do what they want to do. And sometimes from the outside it can seem careless or reckless, but they really *enjoy* their lives. 

My wife is this way, and it's something I'm really grateful for. She's always down for anything. She's never put pressure on me to do things a certain way or not make certain choices because they're risky. 

Why play it safe? Why only make decisions for maximum efficiency and lack of risk? It's ok to say yes sometimes. In life, we're all stumbling down dimly lit corridors, trying not to trip, straining to see the way ahead, hoping that door we just walked through was the right one. And that's ok. 

I think this is part of what Jesus meant when he said not to be anxious about what we're going to eat, what we're going to wear or what is going to happen tomorrow. All we have is today and I wonder what I would do differently if I really thought today was my *last* day.

The ability to push aside my fear of failure and the unknown comes from a belief that God is sovereign in my life. He has [planned my steps](http://bible.us/ps139.13.esv) and [promised good](http://bible.us/rom8.28.es). I really don't have to fear that every choice I make has life-altering, apocalyptic consequences attached to it. 

I'm in the middle of some serious shifts in my business. Things are growing like crazy and last week I felt all these fears crop up again. There are a lot of unknowns. It's like I'm at the plate, the game is on the line and I'm really hoping I don't strike out. This kind of pressure can be crippling and often, I choke, unable to swing at all. But then I realize that fear has led me to miss out on a lot of happiness. The point isn't necessarily to hit a home run; the point is to enjoy the game. 

I'm encouraged by verses like [this one](http://bible.us/rom8.28.esv). I have to let go of what might happen if I were to actually *live* my life instead of just plan and organize it. I may, and usually do, fail. But from a certain point of view, failure doesn't have to be failure.

Learning to be ok with whatever comes around the corner is a struggle for me, but it's one that I think we all have to get on the other side of. Life really is an experiment. And depending on your point of view, it can be a really fun experiment.
