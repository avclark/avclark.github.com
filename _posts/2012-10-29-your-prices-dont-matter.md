title: Your Prices Don't Matter
sub: Thoughts on quantifying your value
---

My [post on pricing](http://thegentlymad.com/2012/10/26/you-get-what-you-price-for/) last week seems to have hit a nerve. So far, it's the most re-tweeted, favorited, read and shared article I've written. A lot of people have been emailing and asking for advise on what and how they should charge. 

Let me say right away, I am no expert. How I've chosen to identify my value and sell that to clients is what has worked for me and is based on many factors. It's impossible for me to tell you how much you should charge and how you should go about charging it. However, I think there are some general principles in play here that everyone can benefit from. 

Honestly, it doesn't matter what you charge. Pick a number. I can't tell you how many times I've set a price simply because it *felt* good; it was easily divisible or whatever. The issue is not what you charge; the issue is what value you bring to the table and how well you sell that value to your clients. 

*(As I type these words I'm a little taken aback because I am **not** a salesman. I've always had a hard time putting myself out there and selling myself. And I honestly feel like I suck at estimating and pricing, which is why it's a bit surreal that a post about pricing generated so much response.)*

What you charge is irrelevant. You have to move the conversation away from your *cost* to your value. Those things may seem the same, but they are not. Value can't be measured in "time" and is often difficult to attach a price to.  

You've probably heard the anecdote about Picasso sketching in the park. A woman approaches him and begs for a portrait. A few minutes later, he hands her the sketch. She asks how much she owes him, and he replies, "5000 fancs, madam." Outraged, she tells him that price is ridiculous, considering it only took him a few minutes. Picasso responds with, "No, madam, it took me my whole life."

Whether or not that story actually occurred, it illustrates a very true principle: the value of what we do cannot be measured in time. That's one of the reasons hourly pricing is such a bad idea. 

Part of what makes this difficult is that often what a client asks for is not what they need. Clients experience certain pain points in their businesses. Then they decide that the solution to those pain points is xyz (a new website, a new logo, whatever). Next, they start looking for a company or individual who can give them xyz in exchange for some money. The client already thinks they know what they need, so what they are looking for is an implementer&mdash;someone to follow the instructions they have set out as the solution to their problems. 

You can't make much money doing this kind of work. Since the client is simply looking for implementation, they will shop around until they find the cheapest implementer. But you are not an implementer of solutions, you are a creator of solutions.

Imagine I have a really bad headache. What do I do? Well, of course, I determine why I have this headache (probably a brain tumor). Then, I figure out the best way to remove a brain tumor (because clearly brain tumors must be removed). After unsuccessfully trying to remove the tumor, I decide to hire someone to remove it for me. 

This is what you do when you have a headache, right? In case my sarcasm isn't clear, the answer is ***of course not!*** But this is how many businesses approach the web industry. Did you see how many assumptions I made about my headache? Clients also make similar logical leaps when attempting to diagnose their own problems. 

Clients come to us with their perceived problem (the brain tumor) and it's our job as web workers to get down to the real problem (the headache). When you do this successfully, a lightbulb goes off in your client's head and suddenly you become much more valuable to them (and consequently worth a lot more money). 

Usually, the first thing a client wants to know is how much my services will cost. But I don't answer that question right away. I spend a lot of time asking my own questions and figuring out what those pain points are. This doesn't happen in one email or one phone call, but once I've identified the root issues, I'm able to give clients solutions that will actually benefit them. Often, these solutions are unrelated to why they originally called me. 

I realize that none of this gets into the nitty gritty of what you should charge. And that's because I can't tell you that. And even if I could, it doesn't matter. As I said, price is a detail that is pretty insignificant. When a client becomes convinced of your value, you become indispensable to them and then you can charge whatever you want.

The first time you lead a client through this process of discovery, upending all their paradigms along the way, they look at you like you are some sort of jedi. But there is no trickery involved. You'd be surprised how far thoughtful questions and examination can get you. 

In summary, a client's perceived problems are usually not their real problems. You are not an implementer, you are a creator. Your price in not based on time, but value. Learn what your value is and sell that. 

Now go, create elegant solutions to real problems, and make good money doing it. ;)
